The team that reveals all their cards first wins. It is best to come up with a keyword that simultaneously explains two or more code names. There should only be one hint, various hints, gestures, facial expressions, and conversations are prohibited. Captains should not react to discussions at the game table and reveal their emotions. You can think as much as you want. The team's task is to give at least one answer. If you make a mistake, the turn is passed to the opponents. Participants also have the opportunity to guess one more word than the number announced by the captain. The game comes to an end when one of the teams has guessed all their words, or if any player reveals the black card.",
